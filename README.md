Kinda useful notes collated together publicly

**Comments and Fixes** - some very kind people have begun to proofread this as I am writing it. It's still a long way from being finished, but comments are always welcome. Make an issue and provide comments in-PDF if you can. :D

**NB** - this is very much a work in progress, released early for comments and feedback. Hoping to complete first full version by XMas 2018. :)
